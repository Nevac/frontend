  <h2 style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 50px;">WTH IS RETIMED ??</h2>

  <p class="descr" style="margin-bottom: 0px; text-align: justify;">Retimed is a local multiplayer arena shooter for 2 to 4 players. 
  When a player is in danger, time slows down in a bubble around them. This gives players enough time to react and try to dodge the deadly projectiles. 
  These time bubbles generate exciting alternations between fast-paced movements and tension-filled, slow motion moments.</p>
